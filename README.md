# Hospital Perfromance Analysis
## Overview
This dashboard provides a high-level analysis of hospital operations, including patient demographics, financial metrics, medical conditions, and test results. It is designed to help administrators and stakeholders monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make data-driven decisions.Also Data cleaning like removal of duplicate,Simplifying the Age to Young, Youth, Adul and old with excel function for easy analysis before the analysis was carried out

## Key Metrics
The hospital analysis dashboard from 2019 to 2024 reveals key trends in patient demographics, medical conditions, and financial data. Key findings include: 
- Total Patients**: 40,235 (with 600 Roman patients). 
- Total Doctors**: 40,341 (1 patient per doctor on average). 
- Revenue**: $1.42 billion received, with patients paying an average of $15.54. 
- Gender Disparities**: Males and females exhibit differences in medical conditions and payments. For example, 50% of payments were made by females, while males showed higher rates of certain conditions. 
- Medical Conditions**: Adults, particularly males, are more frequently affected by diabetes and arthritis. Test results showed 96/626 abnormalities. 
- Age Brackets**: Conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis are prevalent across age groups, with adults being the most affected. 

# Insights 
## High Prevalence of Diabetes and Arthritis: 
   - Adults, especially males, show a significant overlap between diabetes and arthritis. Studies indicate that 52% of adults with type 2 diabetes also have arthritis, compared to 27% without diabetes. 
   - While arthritis is generally more common in women (21.5% vs. 16.1% in men), diabetic male patients with rheumatoid arthritis are at higher risk. 
## Gender and Financial Trends: 
   - Females contribute 50% of payments, but males may incur higher costs due to chronic conditions like diabetes and arthritis. 
## Resource Allocation: 
   - The 1:1 patient-to-doctor ratio suggests efficient staffing but may not account for varying care needs (e.g., chronic disease management). 
## Test Results: 
   - A small fraction (96/626) of test results were abnormal, but further analysis is needed to link these to specific conditions. 

# Recommendations
## Targeted Interventions for Chronic Conditions: 
   - Implement regular health screenings for diabetes and arthritis, especially for adult males. 
   - Promote weight management and anti-inflammatory diets to reduce disease progression. 
## Patient Education Programs: 
   - Launch campaigns to raise awareness about the link between diabetes and arthritis, emphasizing prevention strategies. 
## Gender-Specific Care Plans: 
   - Address disparities by tailoring treatments for males (e.g., diabetes-arthritis co-management) and females (e.g., payment flexibility). 
## Resource Optimization: 
   - Reassess staffing to ensure adequate support for chronic disease management, potentially reallocating resources to high-need areas. 
## Data-Driven Monitoring: 
   - Track abnormal test results (e.g., the 96/626) to identify emerging health trends and adjust interventions accordingly. 
By integrating these strategies, the hospital can improve patient outcomes, reduce financial burdens, and address gender-specific health disparities effectively.
